  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to bring in and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.  (We will provide instructions on setting up the required software several days in advance)
<em> There are no pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools.</em> 
</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, 
  you will need working copies of the software described below.
  Please make sure to install everything and try opening it to make sure it works 
  <em>before</em> the start of your workshop. If you run into any problems,
please feel free to email the instructor or arrive early to your workshop on 
the first day.
  
Participants should bring and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of 
tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "{{site.swc_github}}/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.

  <h3>A spreadsheet program</h3>

  <p>
    For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set! 
If you need a spreadsheet program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.

  <h3>OpenRefine</h3>

  <p>
    OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning that runs through a web browser, and any browser - Safari, Firefox, Chrome, 
      Explorer - should work fine. You will need to download OpenRefine and install it, and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but 
      you don't need an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its research packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
